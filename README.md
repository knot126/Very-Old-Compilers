# Honeydew Language

The **Honeydew Language** is my first formal attempt at partially designing and writing an interpreted programming language. I will be following the guide at [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) but also probably referring to other resources like the Dragon book and the like.

The language will most likely be C-like, since I quite like those and I am fimilar with them. I would like to keep things fairly simple but I might try to go out and add extra things to it.
