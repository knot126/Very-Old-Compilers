		<h1>Honeydew Documentation</h1>
		<p>This page contains the doucmentation for the Honeydew and Blueberry family programming and scripting language(s).</p>
		
		
		<h2>Core Language</h2>
		<p>With its core syntax being C-like, Honeydew shares a lot in common with programming languages like C. In addition, Honeydew attempts to provide useful safety and complexity-reducing features without much overhead. This makes Honeydew conceptually a lot like C, but its main purpose is for scripting applications written in C instead of creating full applications in the language itself.</p>
		
		<h3>Expressions</h3>
		<div class="code">(6 * a) + c / (d + 2)</div>
		<p>Honeydew has two concepts of "statements": those that do not produce a value (statements) and those that do (expressions). The above is an expression.</p>
		<p>Values - and expressions that produce them - can be moved around many places and have a state. For example, the variable <code>a</code> is assigned to the result of the expression <code>(2 * b)</code>:</p>
		<div class="code">integer a = (2 * b);</div>
		
		<h3>Execution</h3>
		<div class="code">void main(list string args);</div>
		<p>One notable point about honeydew is that execution in a standalone enviornment starts the the function main, and stops after the function returns. This is unlike other scripting languages, which usually do not require starting from a function.</p>
		
		<h3>Functions</h3>
		<div class="code">TypeName FunctionName( Arguments ... ) { ... }</div>
		<p>Functions work much the same as they would in C, just in a scripting language context.</p>
		
		<h3>Types</h3>
		<p>Honeydew uses a simiar type system to that of C; however, the types may be checked at compile time, interpretation time or runtime.</p>
		<p>The following types are always available:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>integer</b>: The standard width integer type which is at least 32-bits.</li>
			<li><b>index</b>: An integer which is functionally equalivilant to size_t.</li>
			<li><b>number</b>: An floating-point type which is 64-bits (8 bytes) in width.</li>
			<li><b>type</b>: A meta-type which can represent any type, or a class of type.</li>
			<li><b>byte</b>: A single 8-bit value.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The following types may also be available, depending on how honeydew is configured:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>int16</b>: An integer which is 16-bits (2 bytes) in width.</li>
			<li><b>int32</b>: An integer which is 32-bits (4 bytes) in width.</li>
			<li><b>int64</b>: An integer which is 64-bits (8 bytes) in width.</li>
			<li><b>int128</b>: An integer which is 128-bits (16 bytes) in width.</li>
			<li><b>float16</b>: An floating-point type which is 16-bits (2 bytes) in width.</li>
			<li><b>float32</b>: An floating-point type which is 32-bits (4 bytes) in width.</li>
			<li><b>float128</b>: An floating-point type which is 128-bits (16 bytes) in width.</li>
			<li><b>string</b>: An arbitrary length string stored in memory.</li>
		</ul>
		
		
		<h2>Standard Library Functions</h2>
		<p>The standard library provides functions and structures to facilitaite scripting and application writing in the language. No extra boilerplate need be added in order to use these functions and structures.</p>
		
		<h3>Memory Mangement</h3>
		<div class="code">@unsafe @requirecast niltype *memory(index size);
@unsafe @requirecast niltype *resize(@nocast niltype *block, index size);
@unsafe void release(@nocast niltype *block);</div>
		<p>Allocate (<code>memory</code>), reallocate (<code>resize</code>) or release (<code>release</code>) a block of raw memory. This is the same as the C functions malloc, realloc and free.</p>
		<div class="code">type *ptr(type&amp; obj);
type&amp; ref(type *obj);</div>
		<p>Convert from a reference to a pointer, and the other way around.</p>
		
		<h3>Execution and Lifetime</h3>
		<div class="code">void abort();
void abort_sp(int64 status = 255);</div>
		<p>Stops the application or script and exits with error code 255 or the error code specified if using abort_sp. Using abort in a scripted enviornment will simpily kill the script; however, using abort_sp will stop the entire program and exit with an abort signal.</p>
